# Stars

Randomly generates a constantly changing field of stars in the terminal
in pure ascii! Give it a positive integer - the lower the number, the more
dense the sky will be.

The size of the sky dynamically resizes to match the size of the
terminal, it'll even resize while the program is running.

## Usage

`./stars` will run the default density of 100.

`./stars 1000` will yield fairly sparse sky.

`./stars 1` will give a max density sky (just a wall of `#`, quite boring)

Try any positive int!
